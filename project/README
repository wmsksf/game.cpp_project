Lore

    The marvelous land of TheGrid (the name of the game) is consisted of Tiles that may or not
allow access to the great hero party that travels through. Our heroes carry a heavy backpack
with all their inventory, as well as, their equiped armor and weapon.

    Some say that, mysterious substances known as spells allow powerful heroes to use their
natural mana (their magic power) to inflict unparaller damage. Three categories of spells are known
the Fire spells powered by the arcane power of the earth, the Ice spells powered by the coldest beaths
of Odin and lastly the Lighting spells human kind has yet to learn their source.

    On their journey, heroes will meet lands filled with terror, places where noone else has dared
 to enter and everyone dreaded the all powerful monsters that live there. Only on rare occasions
 they will find towns (markets) where they will be able to buy and sell their equipment.
